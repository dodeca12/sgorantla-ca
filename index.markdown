I'm Swapneeth - a Computer Science student @ [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) (and previously a Computational, Mathematical, & Statistical Sciences @ the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca/)).  

This summer :sun_with_face:, I'm working as a Software Engineering Intern at [Tehama Inc.](https://tehama.io) -  helping build virtual desktop solutions to help empower remote workforces across the world.  

For fall :maple_leaf:, I'll be joining [Mission Control Space Services Inc.](https://missioncontrolspaceservices.com/) as Software Engineering Intern working on the :canada: Canadian made AI for the :united_arab_emirates: [Emirates Lunar Rover mission](https://missioncontrolspaceservices.com/projects/emirates-lunar-mission/) (fingers crossed I don't brick it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).  

This webite's currently under construction :construction: but feel free to checkout some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/dodeca12), connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/swapneeth-gorantla), DM & follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dodecaTwelve), or send me an email at `me` [at] `sgorantla` [dot] `ca`
