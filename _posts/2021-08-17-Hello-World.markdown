I guess I've finally come around to making my (personal) mark on the webspace - and I've decided to start a blog as well!  

<!--more-->

I've put off creating a website and blog for a while now - in large part due to my indecisiveness with web design (in particular, websites over which I have authoritative control). I tend to change styles and designs quite frequently - and this isn't limited to the web either - I tend to do this with everything from Word documents to PowerPoint presentations to what have you.  

And that's not even mentioning the enormous overhead in making modern websites - centring a div, anyone?

While I didn't quite want to follow in design philosophy (or lack thereof) of this [website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com) (or its many [different](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) [variants](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/)), creating this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with all the tedious taken care of leaves me to focus on the content.  

I've come to love and appreciate blogs and those who write them - in-particular technical and software-engineering related ones (a mainstay of Hacker News). I hope to use this space to share my thoughts on tech, projects, software engineering & the industry or whatever I find interesting.  

More to come, but till then follow me on Twitter ([`@dodecaTwelve`](https://twitter.com/dodecaTwelve)), checkout my projects on GitHub ([`dodeca12`](https://github.com/dodeca12)), or drop me an email at `me` [at] `sgorantla` [dot] `ca`.
